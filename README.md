# SNHU-CS230
my coursework for SNHU's CS230 class.


Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The client is a gaming company, and the software was a basic server/client game design

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I think my design document was the best part -- I need to work on my java code more

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
The design document really helped me understand how the code was supposed to interact, and where each class fit in

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
The main part I want to revise is my java code - I want to try to gain more

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

it is extremely important to consider the user's needs, as ultimately they are the ones paying for the software, and if their needs aren't met, you haven't completed your job as a SWE.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

In the future, I would definitely inspect code of similar projects, and see if I can take away any good notes from them on the design and execution.
